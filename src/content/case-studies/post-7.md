# 🤖 Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Artificial Intelligence (AI) enables machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, and language understanding. It plays a major role in modern technology and innovation. This tutorial will guide you through the process of building an AI Model Comparison App using Maryland Insights and Portkey. You will learn how to integrate these platforms to allow users to compare responses from different AI models seamlessly. The application will enable users to input prompts and receive outputs from various models, showcasing the differences in their responses. The AI Model Comparison App will be able to:

## 🧠 What Can AI Do?

AI systems are capable of:

- Input System and User Prompts: Users can enter both system prompts and user prompts.
- Model Selection: Users can select from multiple AI models (e.g., OpenAI and Grok)
- Response Display: The app will display the responses from selected models side-by-side.
- Token Usage Tracking: It will show the number of tokens used for each query.
- Execution Time Measurement: The application will measure and display the time taken.

> AI is not about replacing humans, but about **augmenting human capabilities**.

## 🚀 Common Types of AI

- **Narrow AI** – Designed for specific tasks (e.g., chatbots)
- **General AI** – Human-like intelligence (still theoretical)
- **Super AI** – Intelligence beyond humans (conceptual)

## 🛠️ How AI Systems Are Built

FrankieOne’s internal support tooling was built on a legacy Vue.js 2.0 application that quickly became a bottleneck. The outdated framework required frontend expertise to manage even minor updates as internal operations expanded.

1. Collect relevant data
2. Clean and preprocess the data
3. Choose an appropriate model
4. Train the model
5. Test and improve performance
6. Deploy to production

## 🖼️ Visual Example

To begin, let’s take a look at the main tabs we will build for our AI Model Comparision App:

## 💻 Example Code Snippet

```python
# Simple AI example: Text classification
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB

model = MultinomialNB()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

print(model.predict(["AI is transforming technology"]))
```
